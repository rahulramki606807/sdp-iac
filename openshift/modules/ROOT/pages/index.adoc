== OpenShift

=== Overview

When you complete this guide, you should have a functioning deployment
of the SDP. This includes a Jenkins master, one or more Jenkins agents,
and services used by SDP libraries, such as SonarQube.

This guide also covers setting up a space in OpenShift that can be
automatically deployed to using the "OpenShift" SDP Library. This
includes a Tiller server for deployments via Helm, as well as separate
application environments such as "Dev" and "Test"

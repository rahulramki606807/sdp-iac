== Section 1 - Deploying the DevOps Tools

=== Section 1 Overview

Once you have completed this section, you should have a functioning
deployment of the SDP. This includes a Jenkins master, one or more
Jenkins agents, and services used by SDP libraries, such as SonarQube.

=== Before You Begin

==== You Should Have...

* A working OpenShift cluster
* Credentials for a User on that cluster that has the _cluster-admin_
role
* Access to the relevant GitHub Repositories
* The Helm client installed
(https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm)
* The OpenShift CLI installed
+

** OCP:
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html
** OKD:
https://docs.okd.io/3.11/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html#cli-reference-get-started-cli


==== You Should Be Able To...

* Modify simple configuration files
* Run bash commands/scripts

=== System Requirements

* Your OpenShift cluster meets the minimum hardware requirements as laid
out in the documentation
** OCP 3.11 (formerly OpenShift Enterprise):
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install/prerequisites.html
** OKD 3.11 (formerly OpenShift Origin):
https://docs.okd.io/3.11/install/prerequisites.html
* Your cluster has enough available CPU and Memory for the SDP
containers (see below)
* Your cluster has enough remaining CPU and Memory for your application
and any additional services (such as Prometheus, for monitoring)

=== Additional Recommendations

* Your OpenShift cluster is able to create Persistent Volumes::
  ** OCP 3.11:
  https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install_config/persistent_storage/index.html
  ** OKD 3.11:
  https://docs.okd.io/3.11/install_config/persistent_storage/index.html

* Your OpenShift cluster is able to dynamically create said Persistent Volumes
  ** OCP 3.11:
  https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install_config/persistent_storage/dynamically_provisioning_pvs.html
  ** OKD 3.11:
  https://docs.okd.io/3.11/install_config/persistent_storage/dynamically_provisioning_pvs.html

[NOTE]
.*Note:*
While not required to deploy the SDP, persistent volumes allow for
safely restarting containers without loosing any storage or history. It
can also make certain pipeline actions faster, such as building Docker
images.


=== Container Resource Recommendations

|===
a|

*Container*


|*CPU (ea.)* |*Memory (ea.)* |*Quantity*
|Jenkins Master |1000m |3000Mi |1
|Jenkins Agent |1000m |1500Mi |1*
|SonarQube |250m |2000Mi |1
|*Total* |*CPU*: 2250m |*Memory*: 5500Mi|
|===

_* While only one Jenkins Agent is required, it's highly recommended to
have more. The quantity depends on how frequently Jenkins builds are
run._

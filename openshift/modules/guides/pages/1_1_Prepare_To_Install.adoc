= Section 1.1 - Preparing to Run the Installer

== Log into OpenShift

Run the command here, replacing the URI shown with the one for your
cluster's master node(s). The URI is the one you use to reach your
OpenShift web console.

[source,]
----
$ oc login master.ocp.example.com:8443
----

When prompted, use the login for your cluster-admin User.

== Clone the sdp-helm-chart Repository

To clone the , run one of the following commands:

[source,]
----
## cloning via ssh
$ git clone git@github.com:boozallen/sdp-helm-chart.git
## cloning via https
$ git clone https://github.com/boozallen/sdp-helm-chart.git
----

== Create Your Values File

From the root of your new sdp-helm-chart directory, copy
values.template.yaml to values.yaml.

[source,]
----
$ cp values.template.yaml values.yaml
----

The installer script will use the settings defined in this file when
deploying the SDP.

[NOTE]
.*Note:*
====
This extra step is intended to prevent users from inadvertently pushing
their values.yaml file, which may contain sensitive information.
====

== Modify the Values File

The only value that you _must_ change in values.yaml is `global.domain`.
You should change it to match the subdomain your cluster uses for
exposed routes. To easily see what that subdomain is for your cluster,
you can run `oc get routes -n default` and look at the entries under the
HOST/PORT column. It will be everything past the first period (.), so if
one of the entries is `docker-registry-default.apps.ocp.example.com`
then values.yaml should contain:

[source,yaml]
----
global:
  domain: apps.ocp.example.com
----

You can also add to your values file any of the values described in the link:https://github.com/boozallen/sdp-helm-chart[sdp-helm-chart repository] 
README.

While the SDP installation will deploy SonarQube and other tools, you
can opt not to install them by changing their "enable" setting from
`true` to `false`.

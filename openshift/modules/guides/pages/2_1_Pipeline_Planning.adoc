== Section 2.1 - Pipeline Planning

=== Identify Your Source Code

Where are you, or your team's developers, storing their code? Ideally,
there's some source code management tool (SCM) that's being used to
centralize, share, and manage source code. The SDP takes advantage of
these features of SCMs in your CI/CD pipelines.

Currently, the preferred SCM is link:https://github.com/[GitHub], which is where the SDP keeps and
maintains its source code. Other Git-based SCMS like GitLab are also
viable, as are other SCMs like Mercurial, though the SDP libraries to
support them have not yet been created.

=== Understand Your Pipeline

A basic DevSecOps, CI/CD Pipeline will do three things: build, deploy,
and test. It should take the raw source code and change it to a format
that will run optimally on your platform. It should also take the output
of the build and deploy it to your platform. Lastly it should be
automatically testing various aspects of the application and all
throughout the pipeline - anything from unit tests to penetration tests.

There are myriad ways to do any of these three tasks, but because it's
assumed you'll be deploying on OpenShift we can make some assumptions
about your pipeline.

==== Building

Since OpenShift is a container application platform, and it's assumed
that your application is being deployed to OpenShift, it can also be
assumed that your application running as (Docker) containers. The SDP's link:/sdp-docs/pages/libraries/docker/README.html[Docker library]
makes it easy to build images from your source code repository and store
them in OpenShift's built-in container registry.

.*Important:*
====
OpenShift has some link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.9/creating_images/guidelines.html[guidelines around creating container images] that it's important to be aware of. The section on
supporting arbitrary user IDs is especially important.

==== Testing

The SDP currently has libraries for tools that run link:/sdp-docs/pages/libraries/sonarqube/README.html[code quality tests], link:/sdp-docs/pages/libraries/a11y/README.html[accessibility compliance (508) tests], link:/sdp-docs/pages/libraries/owasp_zap/README.html[penetration tests] and more. Which
ones you should use depends on the needs of your application. Automated
tests like these are useful for detecting issues earlier in a feature's
lifecycle, where it's easier (and cheaper) to correct.

==== Deploying

The link:/sdp-docs/pages/libraries/openshift/README.html[OpenShift library] makes it easy to deploy to different OpenShift projects using link:https://helm.sh/[Helm], a
Kubernetes/OpenShift package manager and templating tool. How to deploy
an application is defined in a Helm chart or charts, which is maintained
in your SCM alongside your source code and pipeline configuration. This
is covered in greater detail in Section 3.

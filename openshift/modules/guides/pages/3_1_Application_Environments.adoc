== Section 3.1 - Creating the Application Environments

=== Overview

In order to use the link:/sdp-docs/pages/libraries/openshift/README.html[OpenShift library's] , link:https://github.com/boozallen/sdp-libraries/blob/master/openshift/deploy_to.groovy[deploy step] there needs to be set of pre-configured
projects in OpenShift:

* The application environments, one or more Openshift projects that will
host the application (e.g. "my-app-dev" & "my-app-prod")
* A project to host container images that are shared between the
application environments
* A project to host the link:https://docs.helm.sh/glossary/#tiller"[Tiller server] that manages the application environments.

You can create all of these using the link:https://github.com/boozallen/sdp-helm-chart/blob/master/resources/helm/provision_app_envs.sh[provision_app_envs script].

=== Prerequisites

In addition to the prerequisites covered in link:/sdp-docs/pages/deployment-guides/openshift/3_0_Application_Environment_Overview.html[the section overview], make sure

[arabic]
. You are logged into the OpenShift cluster you're deploying to as a
user with the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#roles[cluster-admin role]
. None of the projects that the provision app envs script will create
already exist (not likely if this is your first run)

=== Getting provision_app_envs.sh

Clone the link:https://github.com/boozallen/sdp-helm-chart[sdp-helm-chart repository] if you haven't already, and use your terminal to navigate to
the `resources/helm` folder. You should see a file called
`provision_app_envs.sh`. You can execute it with the `-h` flag to view
the options for running it.

script usage:
-p | set's the tenant prefix.
-e | define an app env. can be used multiple times.
-i | defines the project images will be pushed to.

example:
  ./provision_app_envs.sh -p rhs -e dev -e test -e staging -e prod -i red-hat-summit

this example would create the following projects:
 1) rhs-tiller     | tiller server for this tenant
 2) red-hat-summit | project for storing pushed images
 3) rhs-dev        | dev app environment
 4) rhs-test       | test app environment
 5) rhs-staging    | staging app environment
 6) rhs-prod       | prod app environment
where:
 1) rhs-{dev,test,staging} can pull images from red-hat-summit
 2) rhs-tiller can deploy resources to rhs-{dev,test,staging}
----

=== The Options You Need to Decide On

You need a prefix for the application environment names. It's an
arbitrary name that makes it possible to distinguish your application
from others that may share the same cluster. This prefix is ideally an
abbreviation of your project name. In the example above, the prefix for
the "RedHat Summit" project is "rhs."

You need to know how many environments you want, as well as abbreviated
names for each. These abbreviated names are placed after `-e` in the
script's options. In the example above, there are four environments
being provisioned: dev, test, staging, and prod. The script will create
an OpenShift project for each one: rhs-dev, rhs-test, rhs-staging, and
rhs-prod.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
These abbreviated names map to the "short names" of the link:http://localhost:8000/pages/jte/docs/pages/Templating/primitives/application_environments.html[application environments] in your pipeline
configuration file(s).
====

You also need a name for the project hosting the container images.
This is the _full name of the project_ and will not necessarily include
the prefix (unlike the other projects being created). In the example
above, that project is called "red-hat-summit".

=== Running The Script

Putting it all together, execute the provision_app_envs script, using
the appropriate flags to provide the three pieces of information covered
above.

[source,shell]
----
$ bash provision_app_envs.sh -p $PREFIX -e $ENV_1 -e $ENV_2 ... -e $ENV_N -i $IMAGE_PROJ
----

The script should take care of the rest, creating and setting up
projects for the application environments, images, and tiller server.
For example, if you ran this command, with the prefix "demo", a dev and
prod environment, and an image project called "demo", you should see the
projects below created:

[source,shell]
----
$ bash provision_app_envs.sh -p demo -e dev -e prod -i demo
----

|demo-dev |The Development application environment
|demo-prod |The Production application environment
|demo-tiller |The tiller project
|demo |The project where we will configure SDP to push container images
|===

=== Adding The Tiller Credential To Jenkins

The tiller server just created cannot be used without credentials, so
those credentials need to be added to Jenkins. Assuming your tiller
project is called "demo-tiller", follow
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/admin_guide/manage_rbac.html[this guide<add credentials to jenkins>] to create a username/password
credential in Jenkins with the username
`system:serviceaccount:demo-tiller:tiller` and use the command below to
get the password, which will output a token you need to copy-paste into
Jenkins. For easy identification, make the credential's ID the same as
the name of the tiller project (i.e. _demo-tiller_).

[source,bash]
----
$ oc sa get-token tiller -n demo-tiller
